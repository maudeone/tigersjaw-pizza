## Description

This is a website made using vanilla JS/CSS for a fictional pizzeria. In this project I learned how to mimic React routes using just JS. It is one of the more complex DOM manipulation projects I have done using vanilla JS/CSS. I am quite happy with the overall style of the site, however in the future I would like to add a better quality version of the background jpg used.
